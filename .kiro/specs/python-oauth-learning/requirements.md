# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a Python-based OAuth 2.1 learning implementation that mirrors the educational value and comprehensive features of the existing Go OAuth project. The Python version will provide developers with an alternative language implementation to understand OAuth 2.1 concepts, security mechanisms, and message flows while maintaining the same educational approach with detailed logging and step-by-step visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning OAuth 2.1, I want a Python-based implementation with the same educational features as the Go version, so that I can understand OAuth concepts in my preferred programming language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the Python OAuth system THEN the system SHALL provide three independent applications (client, authorization server, resource server) running on different ports
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL display the same detailed, color-coded logging as the Go implementation
3. WHEN a user follows the OAuth flow THEN each step SHALL be clearly separated and explained with console output
4. IF a developer is familiar with Python THEN they SHALL be able to understand the OAuth implementation without needing Go knowledge

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-focused developer, I want the Python implementation to demonstrate OAuth 2.1 security features, so that I can learn modern OAuth security practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authorization flow starts THEN the system SHALL implement mandatory PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
2. WHEN generating PKCE challenges THEN the system SHALL use SHA256 hashing with proper Base64url encoding
3. WHEN handling user authentication THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt password hashing
4. WHEN processing authorization codes THEN the system SHALL enforce 10-minute expiration
5. WHEN validating requests THEN the system SHALL verify state parameters for CSRF protection
6. IF an attacker intercepts an authorization code THEN they SHALL NOT be able to exchange it without the PKCE verifier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an educator or workshop facilitator, I want the Python implementation to provide the same hands-on learning experience, so that I can teach OAuth concepts using Python examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demonstrating OAuth flows THEN the system SHALL provide pre-configured demo accounts (alice, bob, carol)
2. WHEN running the demo THEN each OAuth message SHALL be logged with timestamps, source, destination, and parameters
3. WHEN a user completes the flow THEN they SHALL see all OAuth 2.1 concepts in action (authorization codes, PKCE, token exchange, resource access)
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, educational error messages with explanations
5. IF someone wants to understand OAuth implementation THEN they SHALL be able to follow the code structure easily

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python developer building OAuth-enabled applications, I want to see Python-specific best practices and libraries, so that I can apply these patterns in real projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the OAuth servers THEN the system SHALL use popular Python web frameworks (Flask or FastAPI)
2. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper Python request/response patterns
3. WHEN managing tokens and codes THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Python data structures and storage patterns
4. WHEN implementing cryptographic operations THEN the system SHALL use standard Python cryptography libraries
5. IF a developer wants to extend the implementation THEN the code SHALL follow Python conventions and be easily modifiable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer comparing OAuth implementations, I want the Python version to maintain feature parity with the Go version, so that I can understand the same concepts across different languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing endpoints THEN the Python implementation SHALL provide the same API endpoints as the Go version
2. WHEN following the OAuth flow THEN the sequence of steps SHALL match the Go implementation exactly
3. WHEN viewing console output THEN the logging format SHALL be consistent with the Go version's educational approach
4. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the same resource types SHALL be available
5. IF someone has used the Go version THEN they SHALL recognize the same flow and features in Python

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the learning environment, I want simple installation and setup instructions, so that I can quickly start learning OAuth concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the system THEN it SHALL require only Python 3.8+ and pip
2. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN all required packages SHALL be listed in a requirements.txt file
3. WHEN starting the servers THEN clear instructions SHALL be provided for running all three components
4. WHEN accessing the demo THEN it SHALL work immediately after setup without additional configuration
5. IF someone encounters setup issues THEN troubleshooting documentation SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer interested in OAuth message details, I want comprehensive logging and debugging features, so that I can understand exactly what happens in each OAuth exchange.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL log all HTTP requests and responses with full details
2. WHEN PKCE operations occur THEN the system SHALL log challenge generation, verification steps, and results
3. WHEN tokens are created or validated THEN the system SHALL log the process with security-relevant details
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. IF a developer wants to trace a specific flow THEN they SHALL be able to follow the complete message sequence in the logs
