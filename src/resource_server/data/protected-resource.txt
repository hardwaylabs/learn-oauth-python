🔒 PROTECTED RESOURCE 🔒

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the OAuth 2.1 flow!

This is a protected resource that can only be accessed with a valid OAuth access token.

OAuth 2.1 Flow Summary:
========================

1. ✅ Authorization Request - Client redirected user to authorization server
2. ✅ User Authentication - User provided credentials to authorization server
3. ✅ Authorization Grant - Authorization server issued authorization code with PKCE
4. ✅ Token Exchange - Client exchanged authorization code for access token using PKCE verifier
5. ✅ Resource Access - Client used access token to access this protected resource

Security Features Demonstrated:
==============================

🔐 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) - Prevents authorization code interception attacks
🔐 Bearer Token Authentication - Secure token-based resource access
🔐 Proper OAuth 2.1 Flow - Following latest OAuth security best practices
🔐 Detailed Logging - Educational visibility into each step of the process

This implementation demonstrates modern OAuth 2.1 security practices in Python using FastAPI.
